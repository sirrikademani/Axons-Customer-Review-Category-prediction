"Volume on videos was poorly handled. Some was very loud, some was very quiet. Several of the videos featured a person whose hands had hangnails and different colored painted nails, this is distracting and unprofessional. Some of the slides seemed to want audio yet had none. Many of the test questions were ridiculous and had nothing to do with things an end user should know. Finally, this product is over-engineered. It is made for Police Officers, not tech gurus. Only about half of the features of this device will be used by most patrol officers. The Body 3 should be simplified, just because you can add a feature doesn't mean you should.

"When we initially switched from our previous BWC vendor to Axon we were impressed with the product (BWC's and tasers).   However,  after the sale the level of customer service started degrading rapidly.  Our CSE changed so rapidly we could not keep up.  We realize that things got tough during the pandemic, it did for all of us, but Axon had a legal obligation to provide us with our TAP refresh at year 2.5.  We reached out to everyone in an attempt to get this fulfilled and that took several months. The frustrating thing for us as an EXISTING customer is that Axon's sales were through the roof and they were signing on new customers left and right. We were losing CSE's because of this, they were being promoted. So, I asked why we could not get our contracted hardware if new customers could get hardware???   We just finished our TAP refresh recently and had budgeted for auto-tagging and signal sidearm.  Initial conversations about auto-tagging indicated it would be several months (next Spring) before we would be able to implement because of the project backlog.  Well, we just implemented auto-tagging for one of our sister agencies (we share CAD) and it's not a major project. So, we are on the fence about Axon. We love the product and the functionality that is available but if you can't get to people or get timely responses from people and implementation schedules are pushed so far out you ask why?  Im hoping participating in this survey gets us some answers.  I'm sure we are a small agency compared to some of your other customers, but does that make us any less important?  We don't think so.

That being said it is frustrating to be told dates to be ready by only to have them pass with no contact, and then asking and getting no feedback, only to call and email again which seemed to force the feedback.  I will say this experience has created issues for me securing funding for future upgrades to our Taser program, but hopefully with time that will ease.  I would much rather be told there is no expected date of service or delivery than feeling I am being pacified or pushed off because either the answer is unknown or not popular to hear.

As the chief of a small agency I am very dissatisfied with the customer service provided by Axon.  We have been waiting for months to get a correct invoice from Axon.  We are using grant funding to pay for this project and have been asking for MONTHS to get a corrected invoice.  Our initial sales rep helped to create the quote to figure in the grant funding.  For some reason we cannot get an invoice from AXON to spend the grant money.  The number one reason i would not recommend to another small agency is the lack of response and lack of customer service.,0,7/18/2022,Sales

Further,  It would be much faster if there could be a feature that could allow us to simply check off a boxes ""not my footage "" / ""not required"" and move on to the next clips quickly.

The camera works as it should 99% of the time. The problem comes with user friendliness. Saving under the correct complaint number takes time and if you punch in 1 number wrong out of an 11 digit number 20 times a shift it will be save incorrectly. The phone usually takes at least 5 tries of force closing and reopening to connect. We work 10.5 hour shifts and some of the cameras only last about 5 hours. The charging cables and adapters break and we have nothing to replace them with. Attaching and re-attaching the camera can be difficult at night.

"Axon's public facing mission is laudable, however often times their own marketing and messaging doesn't match the realities of their customers.  
Making the bullet obsolete and weaponizing drones immediately after critical incidents gives the impression that you're not only second-guessing decisions your customers had to make in mere seconds or minutes, but that you are attempting to profit from tragic incidents before the proverbial dust has even settled.
Can we all do better?  Of course we can.  That's why we train and learn.  But the last thing law enforcement agencies need is the sole source provider for CEW's and a leading manufacturer of BWC's taking a we-know-better-than-you approach.  This is especially true when you look around at the sheet number of Axon employees and realize that the majority of them have never worked a day on the street or been faced with the onslaught of scrutiny which faces officers present-day.",7,6/7/2022,Others

"I used to think really highly of Axon, but the way you handled our recent CSM switch was extremely disrespectful.  Please understand that I don't mean to slight either Steve or Aminata.  Both have their own set of excellent qualities.  For future reference, I highly recommend that Axon review its policy for how you notify an agency of a CSM change.
Is it a goal to have a smooth transition? For all parties to feel comfortable and respected?  If so, then why not have the current CSM notify the agency in advance, without having the new CSM on the call or at the meeting?  That way, if the current CSM has been well-liked, members of the agency can express their appreciation of that person and genuine disappointment about that relationship ending, without making the new CSM feel unwelcome.  Furthermore, if you know that the new CSM is someone who previously worked with the agency in any capacity, why not reach out to the agency first to see if that person would be a good fit, from the agency's point of view?  There is always the potential for awkwardness when you insert a new person into an established relationship, and more so when one party has no choice in the matter.  Honesty, transparency, and communication can help mitigate that awkwardness.
On the other hand, scheduling a meeting with us, but concealing the true purpose, was deceitful. Blindsiding us with a new CSM (and moreover, someone who used to work at our agency) was extremely awkward.  I think putting us on the spot was disrespectful and unfair to both us and to Aminata. Usually Axon's customer service is top-notch, but this incident felt almost like an intentional insult.",5,5/17/2022,Customer Service

We have had problems with the cartridges as well as having several duds. 5 years ago I cannot think of a time when I had come across an issue with the devices or cartridges before. I have been involved with Tasers since 2003. The customer service has been hit or miss regarding responses from reps about questions or returning the devices due to issues.

"The Axon process of ordering products, redundancy in websites and asinine product training process is frustrating. The Axon Academy, the purchasing process of any product you sell is ridiculously insane, and the Evidence.com process is nothing short of infuriating. The multi-factor authentication process makes me not want to be a T.A.S.E.R. instructor every time I need to use it. To order products is another conundrum. In a recent phone conversation with a representative who was trying to describe the process of tokens or vouchers or whatever the redundant word was, I stated ""Can you just take my money please I'm trying to give you money"". This must be a common complaint as the representative agreed the process was difficult and unnecessary. 

Our agency will soon be mandated by New York State police reforms to purchase body cameras for the entire operational force and my experience with all things technology with this company makes me want to steer the administration away from your company. 

The TASER instructor course which I attended last year teaches the instructor nothing of how to do anything with the devices or the software. I sat threw an 8 hour course that did nothing but attempt to sell me the latest and greatest products.

I wanted to add a fleet system to a spare car that wasn't going to be use much maybe one weekend a month, I had continued to get the run around and emailing different sales people with no response.  I was sent to a manager who never responded to me.  I ended up calling my previous sales and they were able to help me out to a certain extent.  I have been dealing with this issues since October of 2021 and just recently had to received a quote for almost 20k for the remaining 7 years on our contract.  I thought this was astromical amount of money especially since I already had a contract for over 60k.  Either way I think Axon needs to allow for these circumstances and especially for small agencies with limited budgets to make things work better and at a more affordable cost.  If I would have known now the service I have received since signing a contract, I would not have signed and would have went with another vendor.  The excuse I had received was due to restructuring people were moved around.

We are happy with the Body 2s and the Taser X2s, but Axon tells us we need the newer versions.  No we don't.  These work great and are simple to use.  Don't tell us what we need so you can make more money.

I am also not happy with Axon's requirements for Taser Instructors.  You require instructors to re-certify every two years, and the re-certification process is the same as it is for new instructors.  The re-cert class should be an on-line class.  You charge too much money for the classes and require the agency to purchase way too many Taser cartridges which are also over priced.  Your training cartridges are just about the same cost as a real cartridge.  Also, in talking with our Taser instructors, the Taser Instructor Re-certification class is more of a sales pitch on the newest and latest Taser than it is training on how to be an instructor.

"I think overall the Axon brand is a good brand but I do think there are issues that need to be addressed and I don't feel like things will change. The first one is the battery pack for the Flex Cameras, we have had so many pop apart because they expand while in the charger. It seemed the problem was never addressed, yes we'd have to pack them up and send them back and we'd get replacements but you would think a solution could have been had. Second was the actual cost of products. Granted our cameras where on a grant but all the tasers we used were not. It seemed as technology grew and Axon grew the price point also grew to where smaller agencies could not afford Tasers, taser equipment and so forth. It used to be you could buy  a Taser and it came with everything as one set price and now everything is nickeled and dimed. Again I understand the need to make money but I also understand that Axon wants to provide for law enforcement but its seems the goal is about the bottom line. Lastly it could be an IT thing or Axon issue but every time I log into Axon Evidence.com I have to get a authentication code. It use to do it every blue moon, then every few months and then every time I log in. Even if I just closed it out and logged back in I had to get another code. Also being an administrator you think the system would recognize the privileges when it came to editing and so forth, that we would be authorized but again always needed a code. It just gets time consuming. These all might be minor things and or personal complaints but in the end it was enough to change my thoughts on Axon.",5,4/7/2022,Cost

I like that they are getting involved with RMS and CAD but there are other companies that are dedicating more effort / resources into those services. Axon could be better if they put more resources into developing a smart-phone-friendly RMS/CAD system designed to work better from a phone. Axon does not currently have an app that connects to RMS/CAD - you have to use an internet browser. This is an improvement that should be made to keep Axon competitive with other companies that have had that technology for years.",5,3/1/2022,Product

"First off, please do not think obtaining a lower score than a 10 or 9 as a reflection of the company itself. I think the company itself is one I would recommend to others (very responsive and very helpful as well as always trying to keep up to date), however, my hesitancy lies in what the general public's understanding is of 'bwc's and the work of law enforcement itself.  Since AXON is synonymous with BWC, it would be a great benefit to law enforcement if Axon itself would partner in a way that allows the company to bring education as well as showing support for law enforcement (not necessarily taking a 'side' when hot topics come out - but to have some sort of way of showing Axon support for the work done by officers on the field - not sure how that would look like but someway that shows Axon is a partner to law enforcement in the public eyes). There is great concern, more than ever that good officers are going to become a poster child of what not to do because of one mistake that can ruin multiple lives.  The good done by officers, that are caught on Axon cameras, are not blasted all over media and there are more positive contacts than negative ones yet we only hear of the bad stories.  In regards to the Axon as a company, one thing that bothered myself and some of our colleagues was when we were going through the purchase of axon BWC's and Axon Evidence, we were advised there would be a way to view videos in any proprietary format, however, when Axon's merger/business deal did go through, we were then advised that this was still an option and there is a way  but that we would not be able to do this without further paying an additional cost (which was obviously not mentioned before because it was not an option to be had at the time).  This appeared much like a shady bait and switch as it was discussed to us that that was one of the benefits of using axon evidence to store digital evidence (future ability to view proprietary video formats) but then not having the ability to have the built in iN-Put-Ace function work to view such proprietary modes (even HEIC and HEIV which are APPLE'S native formats, which is the second most popular/largest phone company out there).  And finally, I think it would be a huge benefit to have Axon employees go on ride-alongs in different departments to better familiarize themselves with the occupation as well as the vast differences of how departments function along with the pitfalls we end users have to deal with a lot. This would also better provide understanding for reps that are working with different agencies (and those axon employees should be paid for this research and report back to Axon about what they've learned).    But I would most likely suggest Axon, however, I would also warn those who are looking around that, yes, you can buy into Axon like you would Apple - but then be prepared to be stuck in their eco-system (like Apple vs. Android).  

Another concern I have is that with the size of digital evidence growing (ie. 1TB Phones) and the speed at which we can upload evidence, I would caution the use of Axon Evidence as sometimes it takes over 24 hours to upload evidence due to network congestion and wish there was a way to have a dedicated encrypted FTP sight that was not bandwith limited to upload evidence.  

It would be also nice if Axon could further look into become a decentralized file system that would allow for faster speeds and no down time in the future.",8,2/23/2022,Product

I approached Axon in early spring or about mid-year of 2021 about a quote.  Due to the changes that were pending in Washington State law, I knew we needed body cameras. The salesperson did their job but there were multiple hiccups.  The quotes were incorrect and we had to modify them several times. Once the quotes were correct, Axon sent a shipment of equipment months later and the shipment contained two times the amount we ordered. I was then told we could keep the equipment we ordered and to ship the remainder back. Then a day later, I was told to ship all the equipment back.  

We waited another lengthy period of time to receive the equipment. The equipment finally showed up in late December a few days before the new law went into effect.  We were able to hold a training session with an Axon Trainer prior to deployment.  That went well but was not the original agreement.  The agreement while preparing the quote stated we would get in-person training.",7,2/9/2022,Sales

Taser has nearly priced their self out of business. Small apartments who benefit greatly from ECW products such as the great ones that taser produces are unable to afford these items. Be small departments don't have access to backup officers nearly as timely as larger departments do. In my state 85% of the departments in rural areas don't have the funding to either purchase or at least upgrade any of their taser products beyond the initial purchase. That's even if they can afford the initial purchase. I am not knocking Kaiser products as I firmly believe in their ecw's and have been a taser instructor for over 13 years. Throughout my career I have noticed that only you're much larger departments are the only ones that can seek the funding or get funding approved for Capital purchases. When I can purchase in some cases for firearms for the price I have to pay to upgrade one taser product that's just ridiculous. We would love to be able to reduce the risk of injury to our officers as well as suspects we may deal with but the funding is just not there to help us complete that task.,6,2/5/2022,Cost

I would like to provide a full 10 score, but as a Chief administrator for a small agency I must provide a score that reflects what the cost of these services are going to do to smaller agencies in the very near future.",9,9/23/2021,Cost

Axon appears to have finally brought report writing into the modern era from the demonstrations I have seen.  Unfortunately, the price point is just too high still.  My agency is well funded compared to many others of similar size but the price even makes my administration balk.

"I was somewhat disappointed on the Taser7 marketing strategy during the Taser Instructor Course. Too much attention was focused on the Taser7 during practicals with the vast majority (all but one agency representative) having agency issued Taser7's. Although I quickly fell in love with the T7, it's just the stark reality that my agency (a two man agency) does not have the funding for the T7. I feel, whichever Taser CEW an agency is equipped with should be the CEW/s they train with and not just the 'next new thing'.

With budget cuts, and reduced revenues during the pandemic, law enforcement agencies are having to make tough choices regarding how they spend their money.

As an example, we are on track to upgrade our agency to AB3's this year. While we are excited to get the latest and greatest BWC, it was disappointing to be unable to get funding for new features such as Aware and Aware+.

Half the systems don't know our agency even though we have instructors and products with you for the past few decades, so that needs to be fixed repeatedly.

There was a couple times I called support and they put me through to another person at Axon. That person did not pick up twice, and did not respond to either of my voicemails. I called support again and they put me through to someone else. I again left a voicemail and did not receive a response.
Stuff like that is kind of annoying. It might be my personality but I would have appreciated even a simple ""I am not the person you are looking for, and I can't help you find the right person."" I wouldn't mind a message like that because at least I know that path is over and I can start looking for other solutions. It's probably because I was job hunting for a while and it was frustrating that people would never respond to my job applications. But I would much rather hear a rejection then never hearing back from the people, because then I know to start looking for other solutions. 
In fairness to customer service, the person who they transferred me to was not in customer service, so I would say customer service calls did there job. 
The only other situation I had that wasn't 100% satisfaction was when I called someone about View for a little while. He said he would open a ticket for me and send it to me so I could pick up this conversation with another tech at a later date and he never sent me a ticket. He was super helpful on the call, but I never got that ticket so I haven't picked up the conversation. Maybe it is on my profile, but it never got sent to me.",9,,Customer Service

I think Axon needs to try and keep better retention of sales representatives and account managers.  We recently lost both reps and were not notified by the company.

We seem to have a new rep assigned every two years which requires building new relationships.   ,8,2/26/2020,Customer Service
Website navigation has been horrible in my limited experience.  I have heard this from our other Taser instructors as well.  My personal experience with the web store has been horrible as well.  A standard format where you can scroll through products like a catalog and see a picture of the item you are looking for would be great.... modeled like the majority of online stores on the web.  I am perfectly happy with the products themselves but the websites are a pain.

"I am very happy with the performance of the products, however, I feel like our police department is getting too dependent on Axon (primarily evidence.com) and once we have been users for a few years we are locked in for life.

I used to love the simple ""think different"" culture until it ""evolved"" into technology that didn't like to play well with others in order to dominate the American market.  Since then I  use as few Apple products as I can now.  Our department, like many others, has major budgetary concerns and although Axon espouses a ""Protect Life"" mission statement, it really has moved towards protecting profit by keeping so much of the needed technology very proprietary and expensive.  It's like a bad addiction.  But because Axon products are very good, the value is there it's just very difficult to consider any other options in the future.

They are certified one time and never go back for any recert. This certification is free with no cost to our agency. These instructors can teach anything related to firearms including different weapon systems. This is not true with Taser. The smart cartridges are a bit unreliable as well. We constantly have officers coming to us (Taser instructors) complaining that the cartridges are showing up as blank. Sometimes you can take them out and reinsert them and they show good, sometimes not. Sometimes you can clean off the connectors and they will show as being good, and sometimes not.

"I feel there are a few things that Axon ""nickles and dimes"" police departments on regarding Taser.  I feel that we don't need to ""spark test"" our Taser every day.  I believe this only reduces the battery life causing us to purchase batteries more frequent.  Taser also requires our instructors to retake the class every two years, which is also very expensive.    We also have had troubles with the Axon in car camera system.  The cameras disconnect often and there are several fixes causing us to troubleshoot often.  We feel if the cameras were hard wired in, the bluetooth wouldn't constantly disconnect.    Axon has been very helpful when we call them on the phone to walk us through the in car camera fixes.  The customer service is great.  We also like the ease of the online storage and abilities to watch all our officers' body cams and car cams.

"I've been an Axon Master for 3 years, a CEW Master in our province for the past 4 years, and a Senior Master for the province for the past two years.  The 5 year shelf life for our X26Ps is coming up in the next two months, but the Taser 7 is not authorized for use in Ontario.  We are now having to spend money to get new X26Ps instead of being able to test the unit, and possibly extend it's shelf life, until the 7 gets authorized.  No one is asking that the CEWs life be extended for another 5 years, but if there was a way to extend short term with some sort of electrical testing year to year or every 6 months, that might bridge the gaps?  Once Axon Canada gets up and running, maybe that's something that can be implemented so some agencies that don't have government grants like in the USA, can keep the CEW program running.  My worry is that because our budgets are always trying to be cut back, that maybe the CEW program is going to be where the biggest savings can come from.   Training costs are increasing with the new Taser 7, because of the need to deploy at different distances with CQ and SO cartridges.  Trying to keep the cost of cartridges down might also help with the sustainability of our programs.

"  Axon has increasingly distanced themselves from protecting the officers who use their product. They have repeatedly failed to adequately defend officers in the court of law who use their products. Despite the fact that Axon continues to promote the non-lethality of their product, officers across the country are still being convicted of various crimes to include murder for using the TASER. (Ex: Sgt. Eberhart East Point PD.) When the TASER was first unveiled it was able to be used at the first sign of resistance and the officer could use it with full confidence knowing that AXON's attorneys and legal personnel would back them in court with medical professionals, engineers and the like. Now according to AXON's own training, it is almost impossible to use the TASER on anyone but an extremely healthy, young individual...and that's only with proper probe placement. Bottom line, I believe that the TASER is no longer worth the liability or the financial cost to departments.    ",0,3/10/2020,Customer Service

Second, I was tasked with getting quotes for the activation systems for the body camera system from the activation of the lights in the vehicle as well as pistol removal activation.
